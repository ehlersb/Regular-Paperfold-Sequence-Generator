Regular Paperfold Sequence Generator problem (#359) from /r/DailyProgrammer

I was scratching my head for awhile trying to figure out how to approach this problem until I read this line from the wikipedia 
page on the Regular Paperfold Sequence (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_paperfolding_sequence)

"In each iteration of this process, a 1 is placed at the end of the previous iteration's string, then this string is repeated in reverse order, replacing 0 by 1 and vice versa."

Input is done via the console just like the 'WordFunnel 1' and 'I before E except after C' projects.
